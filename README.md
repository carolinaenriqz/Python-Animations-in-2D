# Python-Animations-in-2D
In the EDP (Partial Differential Equations) and Fourier Analysis course of the Mathematics degree, we dive deeply into the wave equation, exploring it from an advanced perspective. However, we rarely get to create something truly engaging!

Here, I present a series of Python animations that showcase the effects of waves in five distinct and visually captivating ways. Each animation is accompanied by a thorough explanation, ensuring that whether you're a beginner or have some experience with Python, you'll find everything accessible and understandable.

Feel free to explore and enjoy these animationsâ€”they bring a fun and practical dimension to the theoretical concepts we've studied!
